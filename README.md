# Vote System

Source code for basic voting system with non-commercial purposes.
Present articles with images and information about them. Access to context menu is binding on left mouse button.
Finally present result set of vote.

Based on JavaScript Local Storage, for saving vote progress.

Warning! The original implementation is designed on 'Full HD Resolution (1920x1080)' and contains 100 articles for voting. This implementation contains 25 articles, so it could be looks incorrect on some places. Ðžne not so hard issue, but undoubtedly have a very bad looks is that when used on other resolution, except Full Hd, shown of context menu has incorrect position.
(I don't need to use on other devices, so i leave at this way.)
